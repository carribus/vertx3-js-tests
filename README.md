# vertx3-js-tests

A bunch of tests for vertx3's JS capabilities.

This side project came about as a result of many frustrations with the JS support in vert.x 2.1.x builds and I'm 
using it for the dual purpose of testing how vert.x 3 handles JS based verticles as well as exploring the new API
and functionality that has been built into vert.x 3.

## Tests

* Singleton objects - PASS
* Modified config - FAIL
* NPM module usage - IN PROGRESS
